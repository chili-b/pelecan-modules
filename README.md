# [pelecan](https://github.com/chili-b/pelecan) modules for my Mumble server.
### What I have here so far
* change_name: 
  * a module that allows registered users to change their display names with `!nickname <new name>`.
* mail
  * a simple persistent messaging system for Mumble (you can send messages to users who are currently disconnected and they can read them later)
* list_users:
  * send a list of registered user names when `!users` is sent to the chat.
* convenience: 
  * (WIP) a module that does not do anything by itself, but contains helper function for common tasks.
* emotes:
  * Adds support to the mumble chat for image and text emotes
