# [pelecan](https://github.com/chili-b/pelecan) modules for my Mumble server.
### What I have here so far
* change_name: a module that allows registered users to change their display names with `!nickname <new name>`.
* convenience: (WIP) a module that does not do anything by itself, but contains helper function for common tasks.
